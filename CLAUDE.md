- Performance degradation detection and alerts
- Feature importance drift monitoring
- Systematic bias identification and correction

**Competitive Alternative Generation:**
- Multiple model architectures competing (EPA, XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Net)
- Dynamic ensemble weighting based on recent performance

- Alternative feature sets and preprocessing pipelines

**Iterative Refinement:**
- Weekly model retraining with new game data
- Monthly deep learning cycles with architecture updates
- Error pattern recognition and corrective feature engineering
- Automated hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian methods

**Dynamic Thinking Depth:**
- Context-aware model routing (use best model for specific game types)
- Confidence-based prediction depth (deeper analysis for uncertain games)
- Meta-learning to learn when to trust which models
- Adaptive complexity scaling based on available data quality

### ML Enhancement Architecture
**Ensemble Weights:**
- 30% - Proven EPA-based system (maintains current performance)
- 35% - ML ensemble (XGBoost, Random Forest, Elastic Net, SVM)
- 25% - Advanced factors (injuries, weather, coaching, rest)

## Data Access Configuration

### nflfastR Historical Data
The nflverse team provides pre-processed data at: https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/pbp

**Access via nflreadr:**
```r
# Historical play-by-play data (1999-2024)
pbp_data <- nflreadr::load_pbp(seasons = 1999:2024)

# Specific season data
pbp_2024 <- nflreadr::load_pbp(2024)
pbp_2025 <- nflreadr::load_pbp(2025)

# Roster and schedule data
rosters <- nflreadr::load_rosters(seasons = 2020:2025)
schedules <- nflreadr::load_schedules(seasons = 2020:2025)
```

**Key nflfastR Metrics for ML Enhancement:**
- `epa` - Expected Points Added
- `cpoe` - Completion Percentage Over Expected  
- `xyac_epa` - Expected Yards After Catch EPA
- `wp` - Win Probability
- `wpa` - Win Probability Added
- `success` - Successful play indicator
- `qb_epa` - Quarterback EPA contribution
- `air_epa` - Air yards EPA
- `yac_epa` - Yards after catch EPA

## API Keys and Configuration

### The Odds API
- **API Key**: `629c3e74c23fee9ad4809b40ea3df597`
- **Free Tier**: 500 requests/month
- **Endpoints**: NFL spreads, moneylines, totals
- **Rate Limiting**: Built into `odds_api.R`

### ESPN APIs (Public)
- **No API key required**
- **Endpoints**: Injuries, rosters, odds, scoreboard
- **Rate Limiting**: Conservative 1 request/second
- **Fallback**: Automatic failover in unified system

## Performance Benchmarks

### Current System Performance
- **Prediction Accuracy**: 4.4 point average error (vs 9.89 basic model)
- **ATS Success**: 81.2% Week 1, 68.8% Week 2 (2025)
- **Betting Discipline**: Max 1.5u, average 9 units per week
- **Conservative Approach**: 56.2% of games recommended

### ML Enhancement Targets
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Target 3.5-4.0 point average error  
- **Directional Accuracy**: +5-8% improvement vs Vegas
- **Feature Count**: 50+ advanced metrics from nflfastR
- **Backtesting**: 25 years of historical validation (1999-2024)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Data Access Problems
**Issue**: nflreadr HTTP errors
```
URL 'https://github.com/nflverse/nfldata/raw/master/data/games.rds': status was 'HTTP response code said error'
```
**Solution**: Implemented robust fallback system using local Week 1-2 performance ratings

**Issue**: ESPN API 403 errors
**Solution**: Added retry logic and rate limiting (1 req/second)

### Schedule Accuracy Issues
**Critical Fix**: Week 3 schedule correction
- **Wrong**: ATL @ KC, KC @ NYJ  
- **Correct**: KC @ NYG (Kansas City Chiefs @ New York Giants)
- **Source**: Official 2025 NFL schedule CSV

### Model Performance
**Issue**: Initial model 9.89 point average error
**Solution**: EPA integration reduced to 4.4 points
**Next**: ML ensemble targeting 3.5-4.0 points

## Notes for Claude Code Sessions

### Context Preservation
- Always check todo list status before starting
- Maintain conservative betting philosophy (max 1.5u)
- Preserve EPA system as core component (30% weight in ensemble)
- Keep focus on long-term profitability over short-term gains

### Code Standards
- Use descriptive function names with clear documentation
- Implement robust error handling for API failures
- Add progress indicators for long-running processes
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing EPA system

### Testing Philosophy
- Always backtest on historical data before production
- Use walk-forward validation (respects temporal order)
- Validate against Week 1-2 2025 known results
- Conservative thresholds for betting recommendations
