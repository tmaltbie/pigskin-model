# üèà Pigskin Model

## Goal & Purpose

**Primary Goal**: Build a disciplined, data-driven NFL spread prediction system that consistently identifies value betting opportunities while maintaining strict bankroll management.

**Core Philosophy**:
- **Expected Value Focus**: Only bet when our model identifies genuine statistical edges (2+ points)
- **Conservative Sizing**: Maximum 1.5u bets with disciplined 1u standard sizing
- **Current Season Emphasis**: Heavy weighting on 2025 EPA data (80%) over historical performance
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: EPA metrics, injuries, rest, weather, and situational factors

**Success Metrics**:
- Target 55%+ Against The Spread (ATS) accuracy
- Positive expected value on all recommended bets
- Maximum 10-15% of bankroll in action per week
- Long-term profitable returns through disciplined process

## Model Performance

**Week 1 2025**: 81.2% ATS Success (13/16 games)  
**Week 2 2025**: 68.8% ATS Success (11/16 games)  
**Prediction Accuracy**: 4.4 point average error (EPA model) vs 9.89 points (basic model)
